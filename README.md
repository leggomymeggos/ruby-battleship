# Battleship

##Summary

This is an interactive command-line game of Battleship! The full rules are on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)), but here's an abridged version from [Samuel Bednar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Battleships_Paper_Game.svg):

1. Each player has two 10x10 boards with columns labeled 1-10 and rows labeled A-J, one labeled "Your Ships" to represent their own ships and one to represent their opponent's board, labeled "Enemy Ships."
2. Each player arranges their ships on their own board, see the fleet table below.
3. Take turns firing a salvo at your opponent, calling out squares as "A3", "B6", etc. A salvo is the number of shots equal to the number of ships you have left.
